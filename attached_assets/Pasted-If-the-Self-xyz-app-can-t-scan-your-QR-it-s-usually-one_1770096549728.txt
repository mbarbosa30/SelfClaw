If the Self.xyz app can’t scan your QR, it’s usually one of these buckets:

1. **You’re trying to scan a QR on the same phone** (camera can’t see its own screen)
2. The QR **doesn’t encode a Self-compatible link/payload** (wrong format, too long, stale)
3. Your SelfApp config has a **scope / endpointType / endpoint mismatch**, so the app refuses the request after reading it

Here’s a step-by-step triage that maps directly to Self’s docs.

---

## 1) First: are you scanning on the same device?

If your verification page is on your phone and you’re trying to “scan” the QR with the same phone, that won’t work.

Self explicitly supports **deeplinking** for same-device verification (tap to open the app instead of scanning). Use the universal link generated from your SelfApp config. ([Self Docs][1])

**Fix:** add a “Open in Self app” button using `getUniversalLink(selfApp)` (their docs show exactly this). ([Self Docs][1])

---

## 2) Validate the QR actually contains a Self universal link

Do this quick test:

* Open your phone’s normal camera (or any QR reader)
* Scan the QR
* It should resolve to a **Self universal link** (and usually offer “Open in Self”)

If it scans as random text, empty, or a URL that isn’t a Self link, the Self app won’t recognize it.

If you’re using Self’s component, make sure you’re generating the QR via their SDK and passing a proper `SelfApp` built with `SelfAppBuilder`. ([Self Docs][2])

Common gotcha: the QR is generated from an incomplete `SelfApp` config (missing required props), or you’re rendering a cached/old QR that no longer matches the current session/config.

---

## 3) Check the 3 “killer mismatches”: scope, endpointType, endpoint

Self has a dedicated troubleshooting page and these are top offenders: ([Self Docs][3])

### A) Scope mismatch

If your frontend QR uses `scope = "X"` but your backend/contract expects `scopeSeed = "Y"`, you can get “doesn’t work” behavior (often after scan). Self calls this out explicitly. ([Self Docs][3])

**Fix:** ensure the scope in your `SelfAppBuilder` matches the scope seed used in your backend/contract deployment. ([Self Docs][3])

### B) Wrong endpointType vs endpoint (“Invalid to address”)

Self is strict here: if you configure it as onchain but provide an HTTPS URL, or configure HTTPS but provide a contract address, it will fail. ([Self Docs][3])

Rules from docs:

* `endpointType: celo` → `endpoint` must be a **Celo mainnet contract address**
* `endpointType: celo-staging` → `endpoint` must be a **Celo Sepolia contract address**
* `endpointType: https` → `endpoint` must be an **HTTP(S) endpoint URL** ([Self Docs][3])

### C) Config mismatch / invalid config id

If you’re using **Mock Passport** settings against a mainnet config, Self warns this can trigger “Invalid config ID” issues. ([Self Docs][3])

This often shows up after scanning when verification begins.

---

## 4) If you’re using the QRCode SDK, verify you’re using the right package + props

Self’s QRCode SDK expects you to:

1. build a `SelfApp` with `SelfAppBuilder`
2. pass it into `SelfQRcodeWrapper` (or similar) and handle `onSuccess/onError` ([Self Docs][2])

Make sure your `endpointType` is one of:
`https | staging_https | celo | staging_celo` and that `endpoint` matches that type. ([Self Docs][4])

---

## 5) Very boring QR issues (but surprisingly common)

If the Self app doesn’t even “see” the QR:

* QR too small / low contrast / blurred (especially on retina + scaling)
* glare or dark mode backgrounds
* too much encoded data (dense QR) ([qr-code-generator.com][5])

Quick fix: increase QR size, add quiet zone/margins, use high contrast, avoid CSS scaling.

---

## The fastest way to pinpoint it (no guessing)

When the scan fails, which of these happens?

1. **Self app doesn’t react at all** (can’t detect QR)
   → likely QR image/contrast/size, or you’re scanning on same device without deeplink

2. **Self app opens but shows an error**
   → usually `endpointType/endpoint` mismatch (“Invalid to address”) or `scope/config` mismatch ([Self Docs][3])

If you paste the exact error text from the Self app (or your `onError` callback), I can map it to the precise fix in your config in one pass.
