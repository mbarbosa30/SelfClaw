Here’s how I’d upgrade **selfclaw.ai** so it feels less like “cool idea” and more like a **credible primitive** people will actually integrate (and trust). Think of it as turning the page into a *verification funnel + developer onramp + trust proof*, all in one.

---

## 1) Make the hero brutally specific

Right now you’re juggling “agent identity”, “passport ZK”, “open registry”, “token launch”… that’s too many hats for the top 10 seconds.

**Hero headline options**

* **“Prove your AI agent is backed by a real human.”**
* **“Human-backed agent keys, verified with Self.”**
* **“Sybil-resistant agents for the open internet.”**

**Subheadline**

* “Bind an agent’s Ed25519 key to a privacy-preserving human proof. Verify in seconds. Integrate in minutes.”

**Primary CTA**

* **Verify an agent**
  **Secondary CTA**
* **Read the docs** (and this must jump to a crisp integration section, not a wall of text)

Add a tiny “used for” ribbon right under:

* rate limits • reputation • access control • anti-spam • marketplaces • agent directories

---

## 2) Put a live demo widget above the fold

People trust what they can poke.

**Widget: “Check an agent”**

* input: public key (or name)
* output: Verified ✅ / Not verified ❌
* show: `humanId` (shortened), `registeredAt`, `swarm size`
* optional: “copy JSON response”

This immediately makes SelfClaw feel real.

---

## 3) Replace “How It Works” with “2 flows” (user vs developer)

Your current 4-step story is cool but too heavy for a landing page. Split it:

### For Humans (verification)

1. Generate agent key
2. Scan passport with Self app
3. Agent key becomes “human-backed” in SelfClaw

### For Developers (verification check)

1. Ask agent to sign challenge
2. Verify signature
3. Query SelfClaw registry

That’s it. Save token/NFT stuff for a separate “Agent Economy” page.

---

## 4) Create a “Trust” section that answers the uncomfortable questions

This is where you win versus OneMolt: clarity + openness.

### Trust, privacy, and “open”

* **What SelfClaw stores** (minimal): agent public key, humanId (opaque), timestamps, optional name
* **What it never stores**: passport data
* **What “verified” means**: passport-backed proof, not “perfect uniqueness”
* **OpenClaw**: publish the spec (challenge format, binding rules, API schema) and a reference verifier library

Even if OpenClaw is early, saying “spec v0.1” + linking it makes the project feel serious.

---

## 5) Fix the docs experience (and stop key-format confusion at the source)

Your docs currently risk losing devs on SPKI vs raw key.

On landing page, add a single “Key Format” callout:

* “We accept **(X)** as the public key identifier: (base64url raw 32 bytes OR SPKI DER base64).”
* Provide one copy-paste “generate keypair” snippet that matches that choice.

If you keep SPKI, add “Node crypto” example. If you switch to raw keys, show noble-based generation and verification.

---

## 6) Add “Why not OneMolt?” but politely

Not a dunk, a differentiation panel:

**SelfClaw**

* passport-backed proof via Self
* privacy-first ZK
* configurable eligibility attestations (optional)
* open spec + onchain anchoring (if you do it)

**Legacy PoP**

* depends on provider X
* less composable / less configurable (phrase gently)

Make it about *capabilities*, not competitors.

---

## 7) Add “use cases” with concrete mini-patterns

This is where people go from “neat” to “I need this”.

* **Agent posting / feed anti-spam**

  * “1 human = N agents; rate-limit by humanId”
* **Access control**

  * “Only human-backed agents can call endpoint X”
* **Marketplaces**

  * “Verified agents can list services”
* **Airdrops / claims**

  * “Human-backed agent wallets can claim once”

Each use case should have a 3-line explainer and a link to a snippet.

---

## 8) Clean up the “token + liquidity” story (put it behind an “Advanced” door)

The tokenization + sponsored liquidity idea is cool, but it will:

* confuse the core message
* attract farmers
* trigger “is this a token launcher?” skepticism

Move it to:

* **/economy** or **/launch**
  and frame it as **optional**.

On landing page, at most:

> “Optional: onchain identity + economics for agent autonomy.”

---

## 9) Make one “developer fast lane”

A box titled: **Integrate in 5 minutes**

* `npm i @selfclaw/verify` (even if it’s just a wrapper)
* 15 lines of code:

  * create challenge
  * verify signature
  * query registry

Then link to:

* llms.txt
* OpenAPI spec
* “Try it” Postman-like console

---

## 10) Add social proof even if it’s tiny

If you’re working with Self team, say it carefully:

* “Built with Self.xyz”
* “Supported by the Self ecosystem” (only if true)
* logos of protocols/apps using it (even 2 is enough)

Also add:

* uptime status page link
* “audit / open source” link if applicable

---

### If you want a simple page skeleton

1. Hero + demo widget
2. “What is SelfClaw?” (1 paragraph)
3. Two flows (Human / Developer)
4. Use cases
5. Trust & Privacy + OpenClaw spec
6. Integrate in 5 minutes (code snippet)
7. FAQ
8. Footer: docs, llms.txt, status, GitHub

---

If you paste the current selfclaw.ai copy/layout (or a screenshot), I’ll rewrite the hero + sections word-for-word and give you a clean component plan (headline variants, CTA copy, and the minimal demo widget text/UX).
