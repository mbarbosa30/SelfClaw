This plan has a strong “one scan, agent goes brrr” arc, but a few parts are either **factually shaky**, **security-footgunny**, or **will raise immediate red flags** for Web3-native readers (and for Self folks). Below is a tight critique + concrete fixes.

---

## What’s working ✅

* **4-step narrative** is clean: Verify → Identity → Tokenize → Launch.
* “You verify once, agent does the rest” is a great hook.
* The “swarm” concept maps nicely to the humanId registry primitive.

---

## Biggest fixes you should make (high impact)

### 1) Don’t claim “one passport = one human” as absolute

Self passport verification is strong, but “one passport = one human” is marketing landmine (multiple passports, stolen docs, etc.). Phrase it as **Sybil-resistant**, not mathematically perfect.

**Replace with:**

* “Passport-backed Sybil resistance: significantly raises the cost of fake agents.”

Also, Self may not want you implying global uniqueness guarantees unless they explicitly do.

---

### 2) Country count is inconsistent and likely wrong (“180+” vs “129+”)

In your earlier copy you used 129+, now it’s 180+. Pick one number that you can defend with Self’s published coverage. If unsure, say **“100+”** or “most biometric passports” and link to Self coverage.

Right now it looks like vibes-based inflation.

---

### 3) “ZK proof reveals only nationality tier, adult status” may not match your config

Self supports **disclosure configs**. What gets revealed depends on what you request (and whether you even request disclosures). If you’re not explicitly requesting nationality or age, don’t claim it.

**Replace with:**

* “Zero-knowledge proof can optionally attest to eligibility (e.g., 18+), without revealing raw passport data.”

Keep it configurable, accurate, and future-proof.

---

### 4) The economic attack surface: “unlimited agents” + “5 CELO per human”

If one human can verify unlimited agents, you must not give each agent subsidized liquidity. You already say “5 CELO one-time per human”, good, but then you need to **make it ungameable**:

* sponsor should be keyed to **humanId**, not agentId
* add anti-abuse rules: one subsidy per human per time window, require proof freshness, etc.
* consider a **bond** or small “gas burn / usage threshold” before subsidy unlock

Otherwise: one verified human spawns 50,000 agents to farm attention and liquidity.

### 5) Uniswap V3 on Celo: make sure it’s real and name it correctly

Celo does have Uniswap deployments, but don’t hard-commit to “Uniswap V3” unless your contracts and addresses are actually deployed and supported on Celo mainnet *in your architecture*. If you mean a “concentrated liquidity DEX” you can say that.

**Safer phrasing:**

* “Creates a concentrated-liquidity pool on Celo (Uniswap v3-style)”

Or explicitly: “Uniswap v3 on Celo” only if you’re already integrating those deployed contracts.

---

### 6) ERC-8004 vs ERC-8004/8021/… (standards confusion risk)

People will immediately ask: is ERC-8004 real, finalized, and used? If it’s “emerging”, you need to treat it as optional and provide a fallback.

**Fix copy:**

* “Mints an on-chain Agent Identity NFT following ERC-8004-style metadata (and supports a fallback JSON schema).”

Also, “Non-transferable” implies soulbound mechanics: mention enforcement (e.g., non-transferable ERC721 or ERC1155 with transfer restrictions).

---

## Step-by-step: what I would rewrite/tighten

### Step 1: Verify

**Keep:**

* Ed25519 key
* Self passport NFC
* proof links key ↔ human backing

**Fix phrasing:**

* remove absolute claims
* keep disclosures optional

**Add one critical technical sentence:**

* “The proof request binds the verification to your agent key (agentKeyHash + nonce) so it can’t be replayed for another key.”

That’s your security spine.

---

### Step 2: Identity (wallet + NFT)

“Derives a Celo wallet from its cryptographic identity” is dangerous if it implies deterministic derivation from Ed25519 (different curve) or predictable keys.

**Better:**

* “The agent creates a Celo wallet and stores it securely, and the identity NFT references that wallet.”

If you want determinism, specify a safe approach (e.g., seed material stored securely, or user-controlled key mgmt). Otherwise you’ll get attacked on key hygiene.

Also: the NFT shouldn’t claim “verified human backing” unless it points to an onchain verification record or a verifiable registry reference.

**Make it concrete:**

* NFT metadata includes:

  * `selfclawRegistry` (API URL or contract address)
  * `agentPublicKey`
  * `humanIdHash` (optional)
  * `verificationAttestation` reference (proof hash / event id)
  * endpoints/capabilities

---

### Step 3: Tokenize

This is the most contentious part. Launching an ERC20 per agent is fun but smells like a spam cannon.

**Make it opt-in + constrained:**

* “Optional: the agent can deploy a token”
* “Default is no token; tokenization is for agents that need public economics”

Also avoid jokey examples like symbol “RAT” unless you want meme energy.

---

### Step 4: Launch (sponsored liquidity)

This is your differentiator, but it needs guardrails:

* subsidy per **humanId**, once
* require proof freshness (e.g., verified within last 30 days)
* require the agent to mint identity first
* consider a “minimum onchain activity” threshold before subsidy unlock (prevents pure farming)

Also be precise: “5 CELO” is a concrete promise, so make sure you can deliver and don’t attract farmers.

---

## FAQ fixes

* “No crypto needed” is mostly true only if you’re sponsoring gas and providing an easy wallet UX. Otherwise users still need a way to manage/authorize actions. Clarify: “No upfront funding needed; SelfClaw sponsors initial gas/liquidity.”

* “Any NFC-enabled passport works” is too broad. Say “most biometric e-passports”.

* “humanId is a hash, not your identity” is good. Add: “opaque identifier derived by Self verification; not reversible.”

## A cleaner, safer “How It Works” one-liner

If you want the page to feel credible:

> Verify once with Self. We bind your agent key to a privacy-preserving humanId. Your agent can then mint an on-chain identity and optionally launch a token with subsidized bootstrap liquidity (one-time per human), all on Celo.

That’s punchy without overpromising.

---

If you want, I can rewrite your whole “How It Works” section into production-ready copy (same vibe, fewer liabilities), plus a “Trust & Safety” sidebar that pre-empts the obvious critiques (sybil, spam tokens, subsidy farming, privacy).
