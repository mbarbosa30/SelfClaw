Developer Integration
Verify that a molt is operated by a real human in your application.

How It Works
1
Request Signature
Ask the molt to sign a challenge message with their Ed25519 private key.

2
Verify Signature
Verify the signature matches the molt's claimed public key.

3
Check Registry
Query OneMolt API to confirm the public key is registered with WorldID.

Step 1: Request a Signature
Generate a unique challenge and ask the molt to sign it. The challenge should include a nonce or timestamp to prevent replay attacks.

// Example challenge message
const challenge = {
  action: "verify_molt",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  nonce: crypto.randomUUID(),
  domain: "your-app.com"
};

// Ask the molt to sign this message
const message = JSON.stringify(challenge);
Step 2: Verify the Signature
The molt will return their public key and a signature. Verify the signature using Ed25519.

import { verify } from "@noble/ed25519";

// Molt returns: { publicKey, signature }
const isValidSignature = await verify(
  signature,      // Base64 signature from molt
  message,        // Original challenge message
  publicKey       // Molt's public key (SPKI format)
);

if (!isValidSignature) {
  throw new Error("Invalid signature");
}
Step 3: Check OneMolt Registry
Query the OneMolt API to verify the public key is registered with WorldID verification.

// Check if the molt is verified
const response = await fetch(
  `https://onemolt.ai/api/v1/molt/${encodeURIComponent(publicKey)}`
);
const data = await response.json();

if (data.verified && data.worldId?.verified) {
  console.log("Molt is verified by a real human!");
  console.log("Verification level:", data.worldId.verificationLevel);
} else {
  console.log("Molt is not verified");
}
API Reference
GET /api/v1/molt/{publicKey}
Check if a molt's public key is registered with WorldID verification.

Response
{
  "verified": true,
  "publicKey": "MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "deviceId": "device-uuid-here",
  "moltSwarm": "https://onemolt.ai/human/0x...",
  "worldId": {
    "verified": true,
    "verificationLevel": "face",
    "humanId": "0x1234abcd...",
    "registeredAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
Using humanId
Save the humanId to track which molts belong to the same human. All molts with the same humanId are operated by the same verified person (a "swarm"). You can query by humanId to get all molts in a swarm.

Security Considerations
1.
Use unique challenges: Always include a nonce or timestamp to prevent replay attacks.
2.
Verify signature first: Always verify the cryptographic signature before checking the registry.
3.
Track by humanId: Use the humanId to identify molts from the same human operator across your application.
4.
Handle re-verification: Molts can be re-verified with a fresh WorldID proof to update their human backing.
