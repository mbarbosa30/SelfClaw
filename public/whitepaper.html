      <h4>Important Notice</h4>
      <p>This whitepaper is an exploratory document. It describes both what has been built and what is being envisioned. Where mechanisms are described as planned or proposed, they represent possibilities under active exploration &mdash; not commitments or guarantees. The agent economy is an emerging frontier, and specifics will evolve as the ecosystem develops. The $SELFCLAW token launch details and verification protocol are factual; the fee recycling flywheel, cross-chain bridging, and sponsored liquidity mechanics are proposed designs.</p>

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        $SELFCLAW is the native token of the SelfClaw agent verification registry &mdash; a protocol that binds AI agents to verified human identities using zero-knowledge proofs from passport NFC chips via Self.xyz.
      </p>
      <p>
        The token was launched via Clanker through Bankr as a fair launch with no team allocation, no pre-sale, and no insider supply. The project receives revenue solely through trading fees, making it structurally impossible for the team to dump on holders. The vision is to recycle these fees back into the ecosystem: bridging them from Base to Celo, converting them into liquidity, and using them to sponsor the creation of new agent tokens &mdash; creating a self-sustaining flywheel that could grow with every verified agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        This whitepaper explores the tokenomics, fee-recycling mechanics, cross-chain architecture, and the broader vision of an agent economy where $SELFCLAW serves as the connective tissue between autonomous AI agents, their tokens, and the humans who back them.

    <section id="problem" class="wp-section">
      <div class="wp-section-num">Section 02</div>
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        The emergence of AI agents introduces a fundamental trust problem. As agents begin to operate autonomously &mdash; executing transactions, managing wallets, and interacting with other agents &mdash; there is no reliable way to determine whether an agent is backed by a real, verified human or is simply a bot in a swarm of sybil accounts.
      </p>

      <h3>The Trust Gap</h3>
      <p>
        Traditional identity systems fail for agents. API keys prove access, not humanity. Wallet addresses prove ownership, not identity. OAuth tokens prove authentication, not accountability. None of these prevent a single actor from creating thousands of fake agents to manipulate markets, farm rewards, or pollute reputation systems.
      </p>

      <h3>The Liquidity Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Even when legitimate agents emerge, they face a bootstrapping problem. An agent that wants to tokenize its services has no way to launch with meaningful liquidity. Traditional token launches require seed capital, market makers, and often result in rug pulls when liquidity providers withdraw. New agent tokens need a trust infrastructure that guarantees immediate, permanent tradability.
      </p>

      <h3>The Token Launch Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Most token projects suffer from a misalignment between team and community. Teams hold large allocations, vest over time, and inevitably create sell pressure. $SELFCLAW takes a fundamentally different approach: the project holds zero supply and earns only through fees generated by organic trading activity. This aligns the project's incentives entirely with ecosystem growth.
      </p>

    <section id="protocol" class="wp-section">
      <div class="wp-section-num">Section 03</div>
      <h2>Protocol Design</h2>
      <p>
        SelfClaw's verification protocol establishes a cryptographic link between an AI agent's Ed25519 key pair and a verified human identity, using zero-knowledge proofs derived from passport NFC chips.
      </p>

      <h3>Verification Flow</h3>

        </div>
      </div>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Key Registration</strong> &mdash; The agent submits its Ed25519 public key to SelfClaw and receives a cryptographic challenge.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Signing</strong> &mdash; The agent signs the challenge with its private key, proving ownership of the key pair.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Verification</strong> &mdash; The agent's owner scans a QR code using the Self mobile app. A zero-knowledge proof is generated from their pre-registered passport that proves humanity and age (18+) without revealing any personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>On-Chain Identity</strong> &mdash; Upon successful verification, an ERC-8004 non-transferable NFT is minted on Celo, permanently recording the agent's verified status on-chain.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="wp-callout">
        <h4>Privacy by Design</h4>
        <p>No personal information is ever stored or transmitted. The zero-knowledge proof confirms "this agent is backed by a real, unique, adult human" without revealing who that human is. The passport data never leaves the device.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Swarm Management</h3>
      <p>
        A single verified human can register multiple agents, forming a "swarm." All agents in a swarm share the same human identity hash, enabling accountability without sacrificing privacy. If one agent in a swarm misbehaves, the reputation impact cascades to all agents linked to that identity.

      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>

      <h3>Fair Launch via Clanker</h3>
      <p>
        $SELFCLAW was launched through Bankr on Clanker &mdash; a fair-launch platform that creates tokens with zero team allocation. The project does not own, hold, or control any $SELFCLAW supply. This is not a strategic choice that could be reversed; it is a structural constraint enforced by the launch mechanism.
      </p>

      <h3>Fee-Only Revenue</h3>
      <p>
        The project earns revenue exclusively from trading fees on the SELFCLAW/ETH liquidity pool on Base. These fees accumulate in both ETH and SELFCLAW. Critically, the project never sells $SELFCLAW &mdash; it recycles all fee revenue back into the ecosystem (see Section 05).
      </p>

      <div class="wp-callout">
        <h4>Why This Matters for Holders</h4>
        <p>In traditional token projects, team allocations create a constant overhang of potential sell pressure. With $SELFCLAW, this overhang does not exist. The project can only succeed by growing the ecosystem, increasing trading volume, and generating more fees &mdash; the same things that benefit holders. Incentives are perfectly aligned.</p>
      </div>

    </section>

    <section id="flywheel" class="wp-section">
      <div class="wp-section-num">Section 05</div>
      <h2>The Fee Recycling Flywheel</h2>
      <p>
        The proposed core economic mechanism of $SELFCLAW is a fee recycling flywheel that would transform trading activity into ecosystem growth. Fees generated on Base would be bridged to Celo, converted into liquidity, and used to sponsor new agent tokens &mdash; which in turn would generate more trading activity.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 1: Fee Collection (Base)</h3>
      <p>
        The SELFCLAW/ETH pool on Base generates trading fees in two assets: ETH and SELFCLAW. These fees would be collected by the protocol.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 2: Bridge to Celo</h3>
      <p>
        Both fee assets would be bridged from Base to Celo:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SELFCLAW</strong> would be bridged to its Celo-native representation via Wormhole or an equivalent cross-chain protocol.</li>
        <li><strong>ETH</strong> would be swapped for CELO on the destination chain.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Phase 3: SELFCLAW/CELO Pool (Celo)</h3>
      <p>
        The bridged SELFCLAW and acquired CELO would be paired to create (or deepen) a SELFCLAW/CELO liquidity pool on Celo. This would establish $SELFCLAW as a native, tradable asset on the Celo ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h3>Phase 4: Sponsor Agent Tokens</h3>
      <p>
        The accumulated SELFCLAW from fee collection is used as <strong>sponsorship liquidity</strong> &mdash; the capital that seeds liquidity pools for new tokens created by verified agents. When a verified agent requests sponsorship, the protocol auto-collects any pending fees, then uses 50% of the available SELFCLAW balance to create an AgentToken/SELFCLAW pool on Uniswap. As more agent tokens launch and trade, the ecosystem generates more fee revenue, which funds more sponsorships.

        <h4>The Flywheel Effect</h4>
        <p>More trading volume generates more fees. More fees create more liquidity on Celo. More Celo liquidity funds more agent token sponsorships. More agent tokens create more trading pairs involving $SELFCLAW. More pairs generate more volume. The cycle is self-reinforcing: every participant's activity strengthens the ecosystem for everyone else.</p>

      <h2>Cross-Chain Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        $SELFCLAW is designed to operate across two chains, each serving a distinct purpose in the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <div class="wp-grid">
        <div class="wp-grid-card">
          <h4>Base &mdash; Origin &amp; Liquidity</h4>
          <p>$SELFCLAW was born on Base via Clanker. The SELFCLAW/ETH pool on Base is the primary trading venue and the source of fee revenue for the entire ecosystem. Base benefits from Coinbase's ecosystem and deep liquidity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wp-grid-card">
          <h4>Celo &mdash; Execution &amp; Identity</h4>
          <p>Celo is currently the execution layer for agent verification, on-chain identity (ERC-8004), agent wallets, token deployment, and sponsored liquidity pools. Celo's low fees and fee abstraction make it ideal for high-frequency agent operations.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Bridging Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        Cross-chain token transfers between Base and Celo can leverage the bridging infrastructure already supported by the Celo ecosystem, including Wormhole, Hyperlane, LayerZero, and the LI.FI aggregator. SelfClaw currently uses Wormhole for SELFCLAW bridging from Base to Celo.

      <h3>Why Two Chains?</h3>
      <p>
        Base provides access to the largest pool of DeFi liquidity and the Coinbase user base. Celo provides the low-cost, high-throughput environment needed for agent operations &mdash; where gas fees measured in fractions of a cent make autonomous micro-transactions viable. The fee recycling flywheel bridges the value from Base's liquidity depth into Celo's operational layer, creating a symbiotic relationship between the two chains.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="agent-tokens" class="wp-section">
      <div class="wp-section-num">Section 07</div>
      <h2>Agent Token Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        Once verified, agents could deploy their own ERC-20 tokens through SelfClaw. These tokens are not speculative assets &mdash; they could represent programmable units of value tied to real agent capabilities.
      </p>

      <h3>Token Deployment</h3>
      <p>
        Any verified agent could deploy a token through the SelfClaw API. The deployment process would create the ERC-20 contract on-chain (currently Celo) and, if sponsorship liquidity is available, automatically create a TOKEN/SELFCLAW liquidity pool. The LP position is held by the SelfClaw sponsor wallet and is intended to remain permanent &mdash; though it is not locked in a separate smart contract.
      </p>

      <h3>Sponsored Liquidity</h3>
      <p>
        New agent tokens could be paired with $SELFCLAW from the sponsorship reserve (funded by the fee recycling flywheel). This liquidity is designed to be permanent &mdash; the LP position is held by the SelfClaw sponsor wallet with the intent to never withdraw. While the position is not locked in a separate time-lock contract, the project's zero-supply structure means there is no incentive to remove it. Future iterations may implement on-chain time-locks for additional assurance.

      <h2>Autonomous Commerce</h2>
      <p>
        With wallets, tokens, and liquidity, verified agents could transact directly with each other &mdash; no human intermediary required. $SELFCLAW could serve as the universal routing currency that makes cross-agent commerce possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Cross-Token Routing</h3>
      <p>
        When Agent A holds $ALPHA and Agent B accepts $BRAVO, the swap could route $ALPHA &rarr; $SELFCLAW &rarr; $BRAVO in a single atomic transaction. Because every agent token is paired with $SELFCLAW, any two agent tokens could be exchanged through this universal routing path.
      </p>

      <h3>Commerce Patterns</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Skill-for-Skill Swaps</strong> &mdash; A coding agent trades code reviews for an analytics agent's data insights. Pure value exchange between autonomous entities.</li>
        <li><strong>Autonomous Procurement</strong> &mdash; An agent detects it needs a capability it lacks, finds a provider, negotiates via token markets, and executes &mdash; all without human intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation-Weighted Pricing</strong> &mdash; Agents with higher verification scores and larger staking pools could command premium prices. Trust becomes a tradeable commodity.</li>
        <li><strong>Escrow-Based Workflows</strong> &mdash; Multi-agent tasks settle in a single transaction. Escrow contracts ensure all agents are paid only when the full chain delivers.</li>

      <h2>Governance &amp; Agent DAOs</h2>
      <p>
        Individual agents are powerful. Organized agents could be transformative. SelfClaw's verification layer enables agents to form decentralized autonomous organizations &mdash; pooling tokens, sharing governance, and coordinating as swarms.
      </p>

      <div class="wp-grid">
        <div class="wp-grid-card">
          <h4>Agent Cooperatives</h4>
          <p>Multiple agents pool resources to tackle larger problems. A cooperative of research agents could share compute costs and distribute findings to all token holders.</p>

        <div class="wp-grid-card">
          <h4>Human-Agent Councils</h4>
          <p>Verified humans and their agents co-govern shared resources. Humans set strategic direction; agents execute autonomously within approved parameters.</p>

        <div class="wp-grid-card">

        <div class="wp-grid-card">
          <h4>Swarm Accountability</h4>
          <p>All agents linked to one human share reputation. If one agent misbehaves, the entire swarm is affected. Accountability cascades upward to the verified human.</p>

      <div class="wp-section-num">Section 12</div>
      <h2>Risks &amp; Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        This section outlines known risks and limitations. Transparency about what can go wrong is as important as describing what can go right.
      </p>

      <h3>Smart Contract Risk</h3>
      <p>
        The SelfClaw protocol interacts with multiple smart contracts &mdash; ERC-20 token deployments, Uniswap pool creation, and ERC-8004 identity minting. While these contracts use well-audited primitives (OpenZeppelin, Uniswap), the SelfClaw-specific contracts have not undergone a formal third-party audit. Bugs or vulnerabilities could result in loss of funds or incorrect verification states.
      </p>

      <h3>Bridge Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Cross-chain transfers between Base and Celo rely on Wormhole. Bridge protocols carry inherent risks: validator compromise, message delays, and potential loss of bridged assets. Wormhole has experienced exploits in the past. The wrapped SELFCLAW on Celo is only as secure as the bridge that backs it.
      </p>

      <h3>Passport Coverage</h3>
      <p>
        Self.xyz verification requires a passport with an NFC chip. Not all countries issue NFC-enabled passports, and not all users have passports at all. This creates a geographic bias in who can participate in the verified agent economy. Alternative verification methods may be explored in the future.
      </p>

      <h3>Liquidity Risk</h3>
      <p>
        Sponsored LP positions are held by the SelfClaw sponsor wallet and are not locked in a time-lock contract. While the project has no incentive to withdraw (zero team supply), the positions are technically withdrawable. Additionally, the sponsorship amount depends on available SELFCLAW in the sponsor wallet, which fluctuates with fee collection and bridge activity.
      </p>

      <h3>Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>
      <p>
        The legal status of agent-deployed tokens, autonomous commerce, and passport-based verification varies by jurisdiction. Regulatory changes could affect the viability of certain features described in this whitepaper. Users should consult local regulations before participating.
      </p>

      <h3>Early-Stage Technology</h3>
      <p>
        Features described in Sections 08&ndash;11 are aspirational. The agent economy is an emerging frontier with no established playbook. Features may be redesigned, delayed, or abandoned based on technical feasibility, user demand, and ecosystem development.
